### Footnotes

#### Check for all possible issues

The script named `check-all.sh` is to be used to check the sources for all detectable errors and issues. This script can be run w/o any arguments:

```
./check-all.sh
```

Expected script output:

```
Running all tests and checkers
  Check all BASH scripts
    OK
  Check documentation strings in all Python source file
    OK
  Detect common errors in all Python source file
    OK
  Detect dead code in all Python source file
    OK
  Run Python linter for Python source file
    OK
  Unit tests for this project
    OK
Done

Overal result
  OK
```

An example of script output when one error is detected:

```
Running all tests and checkers
  Check all BASH scripts
    Error: please look into files check-bashscripts.log and check-bashscripts.err for possible causes
  Check documentation strings in all Python source file
    OK
  Detect common errors in all Python source file
    OK
  Detect dead code in all Python source file
    OK
  Run Python linter for Python source file
    OK
  Unit tests for this project
    OK
Done

Overal result
  One error detected!
```

Please note that the script creates bunch of `*.log` and `*.err` files that are temporary and won't be commited into the project repository.
